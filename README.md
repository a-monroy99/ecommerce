## Description

This terminal based app is to help keep track of your companies stock and their products that their price and the associated tags they belong to or categories by showing the ID. I learned in this app how to associate different models and their information and how to properly use async await functions. 

## Installation

In your terminal, run `npm i` then `npm run seeds` to access the starter database, then `npm run start` to start the server.

## Usage

Please watch the tutorial to understand how the app functions.
