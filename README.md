# Ecommerce

## Description

This terminal based app is to help keep track of your companies products and it's price organzied by its associated tags or categories; as it generates a random ID to keep track of the products. I learned in this app how to associate different models and their information and how to properly use async await functions. 

## Installation

In your terminal, run `npm i` then `npm run seeds` to access the starter database, then `npm run start` to start the server.

## Usage

Please watch the tutorial to understand how the app functions.
